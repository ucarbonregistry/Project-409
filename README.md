 CDMUNFCCC Methodology
 ACM0006: Electricity and heat
generation from
biomass(Ver.16)&UCR Standard
for Emission Factor

The purpose of the project activity is to generate electricity using renewable biomass (Bagasse)
and thereby reduce GHG emissions by displacing the fossil fuel dominated grid based
electricity with biomass based renewable electricity. The electricity produced by the project is
directly contributing to climate change mitigation by reducing the anthropogenic emissions of
greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere by displacing an equivalent amount of fossil
power at grid.

The PP has set up an integrated sugar mill with sugar crushing capacity of 3500 TCD and
installs new 12 MW turbine commissioning on 5/12/2013 and 15 MW turbine commissioning
on 16/10/2018 Bagasse based Cogeneration power plant. This will remove the dependency of
the sugar mill on the power supplied from the state grid. Power generated from this project
activity will be used for meeting plant requirement. After fulfilling its captive energy
requirement, remaining power will be sold to the state grid as per the Power Purchase
Agreement / Energy Purchase agreement.

The Co-gen power project of 27 MW capacities will operate on bagasse only for 140 to180
days during season days. Actual number of mill operation days will be mentioned in the
monitoring period. At designed level, the project will generate clean energy and after meeting
the captive requirement export the surplus energy to Maharashtra State Electricity
Transmission Company Limited (MSEDCL). All the steam and power requirements of the
sugar mill and co-gen power plant will be met internally from the project itself.
The project activity employs 27 MW aggregated generators along with two boiler of 40 TPH
and one of 85 TPH boilers with high pressure and temperature configuration (45kg/cm2
, 4900C
and 87 kg/cm2
, 515Â°C).
